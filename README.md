Alfido Tech Internship – Task 3 Submission
This repository contains the work completed for Task 3 as part of the Alfido Tech internship program. The task involves data analysis and modeling based on the Titanic dataset. 
GitHub

📖 Project Overview

In Task 3, the goal is to analyze the classic Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), handle missing data, visualize insights, and possibly build a prediction model for survival.

🛠️ Getting Started
📥 Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Manoj4886/Alfido-Tech-Task3.git
cd Alfido-Tech-Task3

📦 Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Recommended packages include:

pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📓 Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open the file titanic.ipynb and run all cells to view the analysis, visualizations, and model insights.

📈 What’s Inside

The notebook normally includes (update these based on your actual work):

✔ Loading and inspecting the Titanic dataset
✔ Handling missing values and data cleaning
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations like age distribution, survival counts)
✔ Feature engineering
✔ Baseline model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree)
✔ Model evaluation and insights on key factors influencing survival

(You can expand this section with actual summaries or figures from your notebook.)

📄 Dataset

The Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) contains passenger information such as:

Passenger class, name, gender, age

Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Number of parents/children aboard

Fare paid

Survival status (target label)

This dataset is widely used for learning data science fundamentals like data preprocessing, visualization, and binary classification.

🚀 Tips for Enhancement

If you want to make this task even more impressive:

Add visual plots (e.g., survival rate by gender/class)

Try multiple models and compare results

Include a summary of insights and conclusions at the end of the notebook
